M compiler.  See the MLANG documentation file for details of the M
language.  The command line parameters are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Specifies the M language source file to take as input.  The second
    form of this command line option (without the -IN keyword) is a
    shortcut that is only valid if the input file name has not been
    previously set, and it does not start with a dash (-).

    The mandatory ".m" file name suffix may be omitted from FILENAME.

  -PRE

    Show the result of the preprocessed source only.  No compilation is
    performed.

  -V

    Show the program version, then exit.
