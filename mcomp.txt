mcomp [options]

M compiler.  See the MLANG documentation file for details of the M
language.  The command line parameters are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Specifies the M language source file to take as input.  The second
    form of this command line option (without the -IN keyword) is a
    shortcut that is only valid if the input file name has not been
    previously set, and it does not start with a dash (-).

    The mandatory ".m" file name suffix may be omitted from FILENAME.

  -PRE

    Show the result of the preprocessed source only.  No compilation is
    performed.

  -V

    Show the program version, then exit.

  -TREE

    Show the syntax tree on STDOUT after parsing each statement.  No
    compilation is performed.

  -SYM

    Show the symbols tree resulting from parsing the input file.  No
    compilation is performed.

  -MEM

    Show the memory configuration.  No compilation is performed.

  -CMD

    Run an interactive command line processor after the input file has
    been parsed.  This allows the user to examine the data structures
    created from the input file data.  The user has the option to continue
    processing or to end the program when exiting the command processor.
    Enter "?" for a brief list of commands.
